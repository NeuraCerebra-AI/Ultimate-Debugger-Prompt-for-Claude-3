## Code Block Format

When attaching project files to the debugging prompt, use the following format:
<attached_project_code>
<YOUR_FILE_1.py>
# Python code goes here
</YOUR_FILE_1.py>
<YOUR_FILE_2.py>
# Python code goes here
</YOUR_FILE_2.py>
<YOUR_FILE_3.log>
# Log file content goes here
</YOUR_FILE_3.log>
</attached_project_code>
Copy
Ensure that the code blocks are properly formatted and enclosed within the `<attached_project_code>` tags. Provide the necessary file extensions and language-specific syntax highlighting for better readability.

## Reasoning and Analysis

The Ultimate Debugging Prompt for Claude employs a structured approach to guide Claude's reasoning and analysis process. The prompt breaks down the debugging task into the following steps:

1. **Error Assessment**: Claude examines the provided error message and user task to gain an initial understanding of the problem.
2. **Prediction Generation**: Based on the initial assessment, Claude generates educated predictions for potential causes of the error.
3. **Code Investigation**: Claude meticulously reviews the attached project code, focusing on the segments related to the user task and error.
4. **Prediction Narrowing**: Using a process of elimination, Claude narrows down the predictions by verifying or disproving each one based on code analysis and logical reasoning.
5. **Root Cause Identification**: Claude selects the most likely root cause from the remaining predictions and provides a detailed explanation of why it is the culprit.
6. **Debugging Instructions**: Claude generates clear and actionable step-by-step instructions to resolve the identified issue.

This structured approach ensures that Claude follows a logical and systematic debugging process, leading to accurate and efficient error resolution.

## Integration and Workflow

The Ultimate Debugging Prompt for Claude can be seamlessly integrated into your existing development workflow. Here are some tips for effective integration:

1. **Version Control**: Ensure that your project files are properly versioned using a version control system like Git. This allows you to easily attach the relevant files to the debugging prompt.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Incorporate the debugging prompt into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline. Automatically trigger the prompt when a build fails or when specific error patterns are detected.
3. **Issue Tracking**: Use the debugging prompt in conjunction with your issue tracking system. Attach the prompt's output, including the step-by-step reasoning and debug instructions, to the relevant issue for easy reference and collaboration.
4. **Code Review**: Leverage the debugging prompt during code reviews. Attach the prompt to the review request and use Claude's analysis to facilitate discussions and identify potential issues early in the development process.

Remember to adapt the integration approach based on your specific development environment, tools, and team practices.

## Customization and Extensibility

The Ultimate Debugging Prompt for Claude is designed to be customizable and extensible to suit your specific needs. Consider the following customization options:

1. **Variable Modifications**: Adjust the predefined variables to better align with your project's terminology or add new variables to capture additional debugging information.
2. **Prompt Structure**: Modify the prompt's structure to emphasize specific aspects of the debugging process or to incorporate additional analysis steps.
3. **Language Adaptation**: Tailor the prompt to work with different programming languages by modifying the code block format and providing language-specific examples.
4. **Integration with Other Tools**: Extend the prompt to integrate with other debugging or analysis tools, such as linters, profilers, or test frameworks.
